     <h1>Invention of the Internet</h1>
        <p>The internet’s origins date back to the mid 1960’s. In the beginning it was seen as an incredible communication tool that allowed computers to speak to each other. It’s impact was massive. Financially it generated 30 billion dollars and contributed to ⅓ of economic growth, at one point.
        </p>
                <p>At first, the internet was not available to the public, and they probably would not have wanted to at that point. Computers were huge; they took up whole rooms, and were not intended to speak to each other. Advancements at the very beginning were slower because of The Cold War. Later, at MIT, they began to apply human theory to computers. They found that they could take information and cut them up into “packets”, he was inspired by how the telegraph worked.
            </p>
                    <p>By 1962 it became clear that a viable computer network could be built. Bob Taylor discovered that a single terminal could talk to multiple machines. Multiplied a few times over, and there could be one terminal for a network. Larry Roberts built the first connection between computers. Even though, now, we understand how monumental this is, then, they were not confident in it. However, that did not stop the internet’s growth.
            </p>
                             <p>In 1968, BBN created a way to transport packets to other computers. They made an Interface Messaging Processor, or an imp. There were some problems to work out: How would they ensure that a packet wouldn’t circulate forever? How would they prevent the computer from overexerting itself. All these problems eventually gained solutions and there was finally a way to transfer information from one computer to another reliably.
            </p>

                                 <p>Later, there was a conference that held different demonstrations of what the internet could do. They found that what was essential to the internet was collaboration. And people were eager to share what they could do. More and more people began seeing the internet as a resource, and in 1973 they made a IB protocol that made it easier to connect the computers. Later, it became a standard.
            </p>In 1992, Congress allowed for the internet to be public. Thousands of people began using it and it grew exponentially. Then, a browser called Mosaic made it possible to access the World Wide Web with pictures and other multimedia. After, internet usage grew over 300%.
