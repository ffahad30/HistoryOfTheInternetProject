    <h1>Invention of the Internet</h1>
    <p>There were two companies that had a definite power struggle in the early days of the internet: The creators of Mosaic, Netscape and Microsoft. Mosaic was the first browser, and it was from this that the internet went from an obscurity to ubiquity. Jim Clark was an investor who wanted to make Mosaic into a business venture. He offered the creators jobs and Netscape was born. Meanwhile the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, had a different view of how the internet should be. He wanted it all to be connected to Microsoft, and he saw Netscape as a threat to that. Microsoft had a software platform. Everything was Microsoft and the only problem was that Netscape existed and could ruin that.
    </p>
    <p>There was a sense of urgency to create the best browser that everyone would use. Netscape created another browser called Navigator, and people loved it. People would use it synonymously with the World Wide Web. This angered Microsoft. They called a meeting between Netscape and themselves. The Microsoft version of events is that it was an unsuccessful meeting about collaborating. The Netscape version is more aggressive. They say that Microsoft made them an offer in which Microsoft offered them 1 million for unlimited access to their service. Basically, they wanted to buy Netscape or they would simply copy what they said.
    </p>
    <p>Eventually, Netscape lost the fight against Microsoft. They went public, and they did make a lot of money. However, when Microsoft released Internet explorer everything changed. Netscape did not have the control that Microsoft had. Internet Explorer had vast financial resources, coding talent, and Bill Gates. Internet Explorer was included in PC’s and it was free to use. Eventually there was no more competition and Netscape was lost in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>Netscape was eventually acquired by AOL, but that was not the end of fighting for Microsoft. In 1988 the United States government accused Microsoft of having a monopoly over the tech industry and using it to prevent consumers from accessing Netscape’s products. They were eventually found guilty, however they never had to break up their company. Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and began to use the money he made to go towards more humanitarian deeds.
