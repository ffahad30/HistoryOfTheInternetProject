    <h1>People</h1>
    <p>In our new age of media, communication occurs between individuals rather than information solely being delivered to individuals by big media. Also in this new age, the TV, music and news industry are now easily accessible to everyone.
    </p>
    <p>The music industry became more accessible when music was able to be found from computers or on the web rather than having to buy CD’s. Napster, a company which started as nothing more than a tool to be utilized between a group of friends, allowed users to share music to download onto each others’ hard drives. Napster quickly became the fastest spreading software ever by October 1999. Users became engaged in sharing information rather than just receiving it, which harmed the record industry’s distribution monopoly. Unfortunately, copyrighted music was being illegally shared on Napster, angering big artists and bands, and it was forced to shut down. Although Napster’s story ended in tragedy, it paved the way for iTunes and YouTube.
    </p>
    <p>On sites like YouTube, FaceBook and MySpace, users are able to create their own content. They can share and access music, photos, videos, blogs, etc. This content is created by users and for users, which is a sharp contrast to prior circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>Ultimately, these sites are designed to create relationships and networks between people. People are able to share whatever they would like for whatever audience. In this new age, individuals are now both distributors and consumers.
