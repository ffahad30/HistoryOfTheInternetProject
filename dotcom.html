    <h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
    <p>The age of e-commerce fostered an environment for individuals to interact with the internet. Pioneering this age were Amazon and eBay. Jeff Bezos launched Amazon in 1995, after completing market research and creating a sound business plan. When it was first established, Amazon was intended for selling books online. Unlike Bezos, Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBAY did not have a business plan or market research. However, both Bezos and Omidyar saw their companies as opportunities to make markets more accessible. In fact, Omidyar saw eBay as fairer than any other existing market because it was so accessible.</p>
    <p>Amazon and eBay were huge successes, both taking off at record rates. The success of these companies grabbed the attention of Wall Street -- particularly Wall Street analyst, Henry Blodget. It became very clear to Wall Street that these companies were going to make a lot of money. This was an indication that the financial bubble was near.</p>
    <p>Expediting the popularity and usefulness of the network were Moore’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law. Moore’s Law states that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every couple years, and we will pay less for them. This law became a standard in engineering because it called for tremendous growth over a shorter period of time. Metcalfe’s Law states that every new node that’s added to the network increases the network's value exponentially at a very steep curve. In other words, as the number of users increases, the network becomes more effective and useful. These laws created the breakthrough technology of more efficient pc’s.</p>
    <p>As seen in history, breakthrough technology is the catalyst for a financial crisis. The technology created by Bezos and Omidyar inspired a boom of risky startup investors which causes bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.</p>
    <p>Part of Bezos’s success stemmed from his “Get big fast ideology” which involved sacrificing profits temporarily for rapid growth. Both Bezos and Omidyar utilized unusual tactics such as “Get big fast”; such tactics assisted them in their ventures. Their success was demonstrated in the huge growth of their companies’ stock prices, which was likely the start of the manic bubble.</p>
    <p>Millions of Americans began to buy stocks in every internet company they could. Many also began to start their own companies with similar concepts to Amazon and eBay. Most of these companies were unsound and therefore unsuccessful. Wall Street, however, chose to invest in several of these companies, with hopes of even a few of these going as far as Amazon and eBay.  Silicon Valley and Wall Street were therefore the epicenters of the bubble. However, most contributing to the dot com bubble was giving individuals the ability to buy and sell stocks from home.</p>
    <p>After seeing the economy overheating, the federal reserve decided to significantly raise interest rates in order to burst this bubble. Then came Black Friday and 9/11, which both effectively ended the boom. Many people lost a large portion of their money and directed their anger towards Wall Street. On the other hand, some saw the bubble as a sacrifice in order to make progress. Several companies survived the dot com bubble and even turned into very successful, profitable companies.</p>
